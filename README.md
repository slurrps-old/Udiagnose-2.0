# UDiagnose #

A diagnostic tool for windows based computers


UDiagnose is a diagnostic tool that can pull up a computers hardware information, temperature information as well as its drive information for all drives that are connected. This gives the user access to see what kind of hardware they are using in the system or by what manufacturer. It also gives a detailed look at the bios revision and driver information on the components in the system. Another feature that is in this program is the live hardware monitoring It can monitor a variety of things including CPU and GPU temp as well as load percentage for RAM and CPU.


In the tools section of the program you can find quick access to the multitude of tools that are found inside the windows operating system without having to look around for them. You can also find many websites that can help you if you are running into an error that you cannot figure out. Speaking of errors in the help section of the menu you can find a list of common windows errors that you will be able to search through to find which one you are looking for. If you cannot find it in the list there is also a search button that will search the web for your specific error (In progress).


You can also save your hardware configuration to a txt file on your computer to print out to better be able to see your configuration. There will be more modules added over time for more functionality of the program. Currently there are 4 modules in total (System Load, System Temp, Drive information, Hardware Information). All of which can be closed if you only want to see certain information.


This is an alpha program as it is still being designed and worked on. But feel free to download it and give it a try.


Note* You will need to run the program in administrator mode to get the live Temperature monitoring feature to work.
